### 2024

This year I'm learning Nutanix at work so the Lab is based on that in addition to making use of some OrangePi 5's I have laying around.

Instead of `homelab`, the project moved to [salt-labs/nutanix-lab](https://github.com/salt-labs/nutanix-lab) in collaboration with the `Bingamon` Lab.

This year I'm using vSphere at work and dog-fooding in the Lab.

Experimenting with `Idem` was short-lived...
