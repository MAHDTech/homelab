### 2024 (Part 2)

Q4 brought with it a change in the day job, now working with a mix of different cloud providers so the Lab has followed suit.

This repo will now move to a single purpose of managing infra using Pulumi.

All configuration management for the Lab is done using Nix Flakes mangaged in [nix-config](https://github.com/MAHDTech/nix-config).

### 2024 (Part 1)

This year I'm learning Nutanix at work so the Lab is based on that in addition to making use of some OrangePi 5's I have laying around.

Instead of `homelab`, the project moved to [salt-labs/nutanix-lab](https://github.com/salt-labs/nutanix-lab) in collaboration with the `Bingamon` Lab.

### 2023

This year I'm using vSphere at work and dog-fooding in the Lab.

Experimenting with `Idem` was short-lived...

A mix of AWS and Azure.
